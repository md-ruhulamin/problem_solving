Explanation:
Input Reading:

The input is read into variables N (number of elements) and Q (number of queries).
For each set, the numbers are stored in a vector called numbers.
Dynamic Programming Setup:

A 3-dimensional array dp is used to store results of subproblems.
The dimensions of dp are index, count, and sum % D, where:
index refers to the current position in the numbers list.
count refers to the number of elements chosen so far.
sum % D refers to the remainder when the current sum is divided by D.
Recursive Function countGroups:

This function uses recursion and memoization to count the number of valid groups.
Base Case: When count reaches M, it checks if the sum is divisible by D.
Recursive Case: It considers both including and excluding the current number and stores the result in dp.
Output:

The results for each query are printed in the specified format, including the set and query numbers.
This solution ensures efficient computation of the required results using dynamic programming and recursion. Each query is processed independently, and results are cached to avoid redundant computations.
